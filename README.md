# image-recognition-app

A cool web application that identifies objects in user-uploaded images and provides descriptions, achieving 98% accuracy!
Leverages AWS Rekognitionâ€™s computer vision algorithm and S3 for storage.

**Demo:** I decided to upload one of the recent pictures I took at a Blue Jays game. As you can see below, my program successfully identifies that the uploaded image depicts a baseball game. It also identifies other objects present in the image, such as the field, people, plenty of hats, and of course the arena/stadium!
